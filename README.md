# MMI Parser

Fielded MetaMap Indexing (MMI) Parser

We use [this](https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/ii/tools/MetaMap/Docs/MMI_Output_2016.pdf) file for reference on how to parse out

This expects MetaMap 2016 version due to output changes.

This project currently does **no validation** with the expectation that MetaMap is correct (it almost always is) and that no manipulation has been done to the data.

TODO:
- [ ] 
- [ ] Update tests
- [ ] Test coverage (missing MMI)
- [ ] Determine private/public API barrier
  - This is in a good place by just exposing MmiOutput?
